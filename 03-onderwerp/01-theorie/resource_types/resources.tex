resources

This is a metatype that can manage other resource types. Any metaparams specified here will be passed on to any generated resources, so you can purge umanaged resources but set noop to true so the purging is only logged and does not actually happen.
Parameters
name

The name of the type to be managed.
purge

Purge unmanaged resources. This will delete any resource that is not specified in your configuration and is not required by any specified resources. Valid values are true, false.
unless_system_user

This keeps system users from being purged. By default, it does not purge users whose UIDs are less than or equal to 500, but you can specify a different UID as the inclusive limit. Valid values are true, false. Values can match /^\d+$/.
